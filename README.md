# Overview

This repository provides a rudimentary formal grammar of beginner-level Hebrew, wrapped into a Python script that generates random questions in Hebrew. The script's output populates a web page, intended as a companion for those learners who would like to practice answering questions.

**Beware:** The author has only recently started learning Hebrew, so the grammar is likely to contain errors. Please feel free to report any issues you notice.

# Usage

To run the script `generate_data.py`, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (2.7 or 3.x) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/install.html). Running the script will overwrite the JS data file `random_questions_data.js`, attached to the page `index.html`.

To open the page locally, clone or download this repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
